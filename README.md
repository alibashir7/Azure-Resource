<h1>Azure Resource Group Tutorial</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
In this lab, I'll show you how to create your first resource group in Azure. In our Azure resource group, we will create a Windows 10 VM (virtual machine) and a Windows Server VM. Resorces, according to Microsoft, are instances of services that you can create, such as virtual machines, storage, and SQL databases. And resource groups are logical containers where you can deploy and manage Azure resources like web apps, databases, and storage accounts.Â https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/ready/azure-setup-guide/organize-resources

<h2>Environments Used </h2>

You should now see the resource group you created in the portal:  <br/>

<br />
<br />
Next, we will go back to https://portal.azure.com and click on virtual machines. Once again, if you don't see it on your home page, search for it in the search bar.:  <br/>

<br />
<br />
We will select the resource group we created for the resource group selection. Next, follow the same selections I made for the following instance details. If you select a certain region and don't see the same options as me, try changing your regions until you have the same configurations as me.:  <br/>

<br />
Create a username and password that are unique to your VM, and make sure to have them saved somewhere. We will need it later. Click on the box next to licensing on the bottom left:  <br/>

<br />
<br />
Azure will start the deployment process of the virtual machine. Be patient as this process could take a while:  <br/>

<br />
<br />
Once the deployment process is done, go back to https://portal.azure.com and click on virtual machines, and you should see the Windows 10 VM there.:  <br/>

<br />
<br />
Next, we will create a Windows Server 2019 VM. We will follow the same exact process, with the only difference being that we will select Windows Server 2019 for the image instead of Windows 10 Pro:  <br/>
